## Configuration

Trucaption can be configured to use Speechly instead of the built-in browser speech recognition. To use Speechly, you will need:

- A [Speechly](https://www.speechly.com/) account
- A Speechly application

After creating your Speechly application, copy the *App ID* displayed in Speechly. Then, configure Trucaption to use Speechly for transcription:

1. Within the editor window, click Configure.
2. Set the transcription engine to "Speechly".
3. Paste the Application ID in the "Speechly App" option.
