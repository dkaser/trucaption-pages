The viewer display can be customized if desired. By default, the viewer display includes a menu with an option to change the font size. This can be changed by adding settings to the viewer address:

 - **?fullscreen** will disable the menu
 - **?size=NUM** will set the font size to NUM.
 
Combining these options can be useful for large-screen displays.

## Examples

- http://*caption-host*/?fullscreen
  - Disables the menu
  - Uses default font size
- http://*caption-host*/?fullscreen&size=40
  - Disables the menu
  - Sets font size to 40
- http://*caption-host*/?size=40
  - Sets starting font size to 40
  - User can change font size using the menu
